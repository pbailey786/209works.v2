## üìù Daily Standup Questions
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. Am I still on track for 4-day launch?

## üö® If You Get Stuck
1. **Simplify**: Can this feature wait until after launch?
2. **Mock it**: Use fake data to keep moving
3. **Skip it**: Mark as "enhancement" and continue
4. **Ask Claude**: Show the error and current code
5. **Ship it**: Better to launch with 80% than never launch

**Remember**: Every feature you don't build is a bug you don't have to fix. Launch fast, iterate based on real user feedback!

## üéØ Key Prompts for Claude

### For Server Components:
```
"Build a server component for [page] that:
- Fetches data using Supabase
- Handles loading/error states
- Uses suspense boundaries
- Follows the pattern in API-ENDPOINTS-DESIGN.md"
```

### For Server Actions:
```
"Create a server action for [action] that:
- Validates input with Zod
- Checks authentication
- Verifies permissions
- Updates database
- Revalidates cache
- Handles errors gracefully"
```

### For Client Components:
```
"Build a client component for [feature] that:
- Only handles interactivity
- Uses server actions for mutations
- Shows optimistic updates
- Has proper loading states"
```

## üö´ What NOT to Ask Claude

Don't ask for:
- Complex state management (use URL + server state)
- Client-side data fetching (use server components)
- Custom auth (use Clerk)
- Custom payments (use Clerk Billing)
- Complex routing (use file-based)

## üìù Testing Each Feature

After building each feature, test:
1. **Can a visitor browse jobs?**
2. **Can they search and filter?**
3. **Can they sign up easily?**
4. **Can employers post jobs?**
5. **Can seekers apply?**
6. **Do payments work?**
7. **Are limits enforced?**

## üé® Figma to Code Process

```
1. Design component in Figma
2. Export colors/spacing to Tailwind config
3. Ask Claude: "Build this component matching the Figma design"
4. Provide screenshots or Figma specs
5. Iterate on responsiveness
```

## ‚ö° Speed Tips

1. **Use shadcn/ui components**
   ```
   "Add a data table for jobs using shadcn/ui table component"
   ```

2. **Copy patterns**
   ```
   "Create an applications page similar to the jobs page pattern"
   ```

3. **Batch related features**
   ```
   "Build all employer pages following the same layout pattern"
   ```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### "Type errors with Supabase"
```
"Generate TypeScript types from Supabase schema and update the database types"
```

### "Clerk auth not working"
```
"Check middleware.ts matches protected routes and environment variables are set"
```

### "Server actions failing"
```
"Add proper error handling and ensure 'use server' directive is at the top"
```

### "Slow performance"
```
"Convert client components to server components where possible and add Suspense boundaries"
```
